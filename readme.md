# Welcome to Hagrid!

Hagrid is an HTML-attribute Grid system used for the layout of your websites. It's a method of styling that uses _attributes_ as opposed to classes, so if you're worried about munging your semantic class names with your layout stylings, worry no more!

Hagrid was built with smaller projects in mind (although you can probably get along just fine with bigger projects).

Hagrid was also built to primarily make a joke. A pun, really.

There are a thousand-and-one Grid frameworks out there, a lot of which will probably use class names and render faster by milliseconds, but at the end of 
the day, if separation of concerns is at the top of your list, then Hagrid might be able to help you out. 

**You're probably wondering** about the speed of CSS selectors. I'd say that's valid. 

Take a look at [this article](http://benfrain.com/css-performance-revisited-selectors-bloat-expensive-styles/), we've come a long way.
