		"Hagrid is a \"Semantic\" grid framework, but it's mostly a pun. It's semantic in the sense that it won't leave all of your precious classes muddled with names that don't make sense to another developer. It's probably most useful if you're a fan of some componentized markup like Bootstrap!",
		"Anyways, I set out to build a grid framework I hadn't seen before, one that didn't need classes to survive. I turned to data attributes.",
		"You're probably thinking <em>\"Data attributes? Bradley, you're trash. That's so slow!\"</em>",
		"I won't say that's not a valid concern (or that I'm not, in fact, trash), but I think you should also have a little more faith in our browsers (and probably me), we've come a long way since the days of yore in the web space.",
		"You want to use Hagrid? I welcome you to! Live your dream of incorporating bad wordplay into your website!",
