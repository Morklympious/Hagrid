		"Hagrid is a \"Semantic\" grid framework, but it's mostly a pun. It's semantic in the sense that it won't leave all of your precious classes muddled with names that don't make sense to another developer. I remember reading about semantic classes with layout frameworks and saw a small (but still valid) problem that could use solving. ",
		"I set out to build a grid framework I hadn't seen before, one that didn't need classes to survive. I turned to data attributes.",
		"You're probably thinking <em>\"Data attributes? That's so slow!\"</em>",
		"I won't say that's not a valid concern, but I think you should also have a little more faith in our browsers, we've come a long way since the days of Netscape and other browsers I've probably never heard of or cared about.",
		"You want to use Hagrid? feel free. I'm not gonna stop you from living your dream of incorporating bad wordplay into your website.",
		"<em>You're a gridder, Harry.</em> "
