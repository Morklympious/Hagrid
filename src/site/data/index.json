		"Hagrid is a \"Semantic\" grid framework, but it's mostly a pun. It's semantic in the sense that it won't leave all of your precious classes muddled with names that don't make sense to another developer. I remember reading about semantic classes with layout frameworks and saw a small (but still valid) problem that could use solving. ",
