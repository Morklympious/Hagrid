I thought to myself \"Why is everyone getting so bent out of shape over what their classes are?\" Obviously I had no real grip on this problem, but I wanted to see if there was another way to do layout while leaving classes alone.",

Hagrid HAPPENS to be the name of a character in Harry Potter, and Hagrid ALSO HAPPENS to utter the well-known phrase \"You're a wizard, harry.\" From there the rest is simply a hop, skip, and a pun away from this fledgeling grid framework!",
