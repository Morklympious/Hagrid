				"Hagrid is this odd little joke that came to mind when I was getting my feet wet reading about CSS and semantics. I thought to myself \"Why is everyone getting so bent out of shape over what their classes are?\" Obviously I had no real grip on this problem, but I wanted to see if there was another way to do layout while leaving classes alone.",
				"Obviously I found a solution in Hagrid. If you didn't already guess, Hagrid is actually a partial-acronym for 'HTML Attribute Grid', which, if you think about it, is really just lucky on my part. Hagrid HAPPENS to be the name of a character in Harry Potter, and Hagrid ALSO HAPPENS to utter the well-known phrase \"You're a wizard, harry.\" From there the rest is simply a hop, skip, and a pun away from this fledgeling grid framework!",
				"Hagrid solves the problem of semantics by giving each piece of your layout a data attribute in which to supply all of its layout details.",
				"If you're planning on running with Hagrid in a project of yours, let me know! I'd love to hear about what you've done with it!",
				"Happy coding!"
