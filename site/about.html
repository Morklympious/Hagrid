  	  <h1>What&#x27;s all this, then?</h1>
  	</div>    	<p> Well, let me start off by saying that's a great question. </p>
    	<p> Hagrid is this odd little joke that came to mind when I was getting my feet wet reading about CSS and semantics. I thought to myself "Why is everyone getting so bent out of shape over what their classes are?" Obviously I had no real grip on this problem, but I wanted to see if there was another way to do layout while leaving classes alone. </p>
    	<p> Obviously I found a solution in Hagrid. If you didn't already guess, Hagrid is actually a partial-acronym for 'HTML Attribute Grid', which, if you think about it, is really just lucky on my part. Hagrid HAPPENS to be the name of a character in Harry Potter, and Hagrid ALSO HAPPENS to utter the well-known phrase "You're a wizard, harry." From there the rest is simply a hop, skip, and a pun away from this fledgeling grid framework! </p>
    	<p> Hagrid solves the problem of semantics by giving each piece of your layout a data attribute in which to supply all of its layout details. </p>
    	<p> If you're planning on running with Hagrid in a project of yours, let me know! I'd love to hear about what you've done with it! </p>
    	<p> Happy coding! </p>
  	<div class="heading">
  	  <h1>Acknowledgements</h1>
  	</div>    	<p> Of course, no man is an island. I'd be lying through my teeth if I said I came up with this idea without some inspiration </p>
    	<p> Thanks to Nathan Smith's <a href="http://unsemantic.com/">Unsemantic</a> for exemplifying the silliness of semantics </p>
    	<p> Thanks to David Lumley's <a href="https://github.com/davidlumley/concrete">Concrete</a> for yet another beautiful css grid library example </p>
    	<p> Thanks to every non web developer who put up with me explaining this joke in great detail. </p>
    	<p> And of course, thanks to a multitude of speakers on CSS and Semantics </p>
