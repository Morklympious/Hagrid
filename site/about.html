    <p> Well, let me start off by saying that's a great question. </p>
    <p> Hagrid is this odd little joke that came to mind when I was getting my feet wet reading about CSS and semantics. I thought to myself "Why is everyone getting so bent out of shape over what their classes are?" Obviously I had no real grip on this problem, but I wanted to see if there was another way to do layout while leaving classes alone. </p>
    <p> Obviously I found a solution in Hagrid. If you didn't already guess, Hagrid is actually a partial-acronym for 'HTML Attribute Grid', which, if you think about it, is really just lucky on my part. Hagrid HAPPENS to be the name of a character in Harry Potter, and Hagrid ALSO HAPPENS to utter the well-known phrase "You're a wizard, harry." From there the rest is simply a hop, skip, and a pun away from this fledgeling grid framework! </p>
    <p> Hagrid solves the problem of semantics by giving each piece of your layout a data attribute in which to supply all of its layout details. </p>
